Data issues to be fixed / checked (last edited 2/18/2025 3:29 PM)

- all_treatments data: starting/finishing dates of iCBT for insomnia are not right
(since all finishing dates are before starting dates)
- all_treatments data: lots of missing values for core-om post treatment valiable (FPQR patients)


Fixed (date)
